This is a personal project, made for scholastic purposes mainly.
For now, a significant portion of the code has been written accordingly to the [Building a bootloader](www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFjM7v6KGMpjWYxnihhd4P3G0BhMB9ReG) tutorial by [nanobyte](github.com/nanobyte-dev).
<br>
The aim is to make a "usable" operating system while still maintaning low size and performance need.
<br>
This repo is still in development, so i highly advise NOT to run this on real hardware. 
<br>
Bugfixes are welcome.
